## Before you begin

* Check out the detailed setup guide [here](Setup/readme.md)
* Every challenge is dependant on the previous challenges, make sure you work through them in order
* Don't leave your team mates behind! See if anyone else needs a hand before you start a new challenge

## Overview

Your second challenge is to deploy a virtual network using a bicep template, once you have finished this challenge it's expected you will have an understanding of:
* How to find Azure Resource Manager documentation
* How to look for examples of templates
* How to deploy a virtual network

## Objectives

1. Author a bicep template and use it to deploy a virtual network with the following properties:
 * Address space: `10.0.0.0/16`
 * Subnets:
    * 1 subnet with the address space: `10.0.0.0/24`

    You can use any *valid* name you like for the vnet and subnets. The virtual network must be deployed to the `east us` region.

1. Update the template to include an additional subnet with the address range of `10.0.1.0/24` and deploy it to update the virtual network

## Success Criteria

You will have:
 - At least two successful deployments of the virtual network
 - The first deployment will include one subnet and the following properties:
    - Address space: `10.0.0.0/16`
    - 1 subnet with the address space: `10.0.0.0/24`
 - The second deployment will include two subnets, with the following properties:
    - Address space: `10.0.0.0/16`
    - 2 subnet with the address spaces: `10.0.0.0/24` and `10.0.1.0/24`
 - All resources must be deployed to the `east us` region
