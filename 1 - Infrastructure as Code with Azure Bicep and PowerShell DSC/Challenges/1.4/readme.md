# Challenge 1.4 - Deploy a Windows Virtual Machine

## Before you begin

* Check out the detailed setup guide [here](Setup/readme.md)
* Every challenge is dependant on the previous challenges, make sure you work through them in order
* Don't leave your team mates behind! See if anyone else needs a hand before you start a new challenge

## Overview

Virtual Machines are the backbone of Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and although many companies are moving to serverless, there is still a huge virtual machine footprint worldwide.

Your fourth challenge is to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine. Later on this virtual machine will be converted to a Web Server, so keep that in the back of your mind!

Once you have finished this challenge you will have an understanding of:

* How to deploy a virtual machine
* How a virtual machine depends on other resources like virtual networks, subnets and network interfaces
* How to access secrets that are stored in Key Vault

## Objectives

1. Author a bicep template and use it to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine. The VM must have the following properties:
    * Use a stored Key Vault secret for the administrator account password
    * Use `Windows Server 2016`
    * Be deployed to the `east us` region
    * Be a `B series` or `A series`

    You can use any *valid* name you like for the VM.
    You **do not** need to log on to the VM as part of this challenge.
