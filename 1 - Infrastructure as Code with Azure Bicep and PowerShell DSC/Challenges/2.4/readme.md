## Overview

Now it's time for the rubber to hit the road. You've compiled your configuration and it's waiting for a server to pull the configuration and apply it.

Your fourth challenge for this round is to register your virtual machines with the automation account so they can pull their configuration.

Once you have finished this challenge you will have an understanding of:

* How to configure a server to pull a configuration from an automation account
* How to trigger the application of the configuration on a node
* How to monitor the configuration compliance
