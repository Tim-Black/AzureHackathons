# Challenge 2.5 - Update your configuration

## Before you begin

* Check out the detailed setup guide [here](Setup/readme.md)
* Every challenge is dependent on the previous challenges, make sure you work through them in order
* Don't leave your team mates behind! See if anyone else needs a hand before you start a new challenge

## Overview

As part of a normal workload lifecycle, you might update the configuration to meet new requirements or fix issues. PowerShell DSC enables this using settings to configure how often configuration updates are checked for and how often configuration should be applied. This is done by configuring the Local Configuration Manager (LCM).

Your fourth challenge for this round is to configure the DSC extension on your VMs to update (pull) their configuration once a day and apply it every hour. You also want the servers to automatically reboot if required.

Once you have finished this challenge you will have an understanding of:

* How to configure LCM settings on a VM to pull a configuration from an automation account
