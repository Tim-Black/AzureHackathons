# 1 - Infrastructure as Code with Azure Bicep and PowerShell DSC

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are are an important capability in any DevOps team. Continuous Delivery is achieved by using practices and processes that include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Configuration Management

Once you start embracing DevOps, you will start to build out your practices and processes, but starting with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration Management is as good a place as any. Once you start, you soon add source control, secrets management, and a release pipeline, and you’ll be deploying to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (Paas) and more!

But today, let’s get started with Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management in the hope that it will wet your appetite and you’ll want more!
