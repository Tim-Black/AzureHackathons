To help you with Agile project management, there is [GitHub projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects). With GitHub projects, you can quickly and easily start tracking your backlog, tasks, issues/bugs and features associated with your project.  

## Objectives

1. Partner up with someone and ask them for their GitHub email address. DevOps is about teamwork! You'll invite them to collaborate with you using their email address.

2. Ensure GitHub issues are enabled for your repo. This will allow you to create issues and put them on the project board.

    On the *General* tab, check the *Features* heading

3. Add collaborators from your team to your repo.

‚ùó IMPORTANT: Before continuing, make sure at least one teammate has accepted your invite.

4. Create an issue for this challenge and each of the remaining challenges (i.e., create 9). When creating each issue, make sure to:
    - Assign an owner for each issue. Assign the `Challenge 1` work item to another member of your team, have them assign their `Challenge 1` work item to you. Assign all remaining challenges to yourself.
    - Associate each issue with the project board you just created 

    <details>
    <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
    To create issues:
    <ul>
    <li>In your repository, select <strong>Issues</strong> </li>
    <li>Select <strong>New Issue</strong></li>
    <li>Create the issue for each challenge. Make sure you link the issue to the project on the right hand side before creating.</li>
    <li> New issues if linked properly should show up in the <strong>To do</strong> column. Once you set to closed, it should move to <strong>Done</strong> column. If you are viewing the </li>
    </ul>
    </details>

5. Review the project board and ensure your issues automatically appear under the**To do** column.

6. Since you are currently working on Challenge 1, drag the **Challenge 1** card from the **To do** column to **In progress**.

7. Ask your team member to close the **Challenge 1** issue you assigned to them. Review your project board to see if the issue moved to the **Done** column automatically. 

8. After you complete each of the following challenges, be sure to close each associated issue. This might seem meaningless, but it will get you in the rhythm of a typical DevOps Engineer.

## Success Criteria

- You have added one or more collaborators to your repo
- You have a project board, associated it with your repository
- You have created 9 issues (8 open, 1 closed by a team member)
- New issues automatically appear under the "To do" column
- Closed issues automatically appear under the "Done" column
