To help you with Agile project management, there is [GitHub projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects). With GitHub projects, you can quickly and easily start tracking your backlog, tasks, issues/bugs and features associated with your project.  

## Objectives

1. Ensure GitHub issues are enabled for your repo. This will allow you to create issues and put them on the project board.

4. Create an issue for this challenge and each of the remaining challenges (i.e., create 9). When creating each issue, make sure to:
    - Assign an owner for each issue. Assign the `Challenge 1` work item to another member of your team, have them assign their `Challenge 1` work item to you. Assign all remaining challenges to yourself.
    - Associate each issue with the project board you just created

 - You have a project board using the automation kanban template with 9 issues (8 open, 1 closed by a team member)
  - New issues automatically appear under the "To do" column
 - Closed issues automatically appear under the "Done" column
