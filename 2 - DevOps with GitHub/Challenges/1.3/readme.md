# Challenge 1.3 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

üëâ Don't leave your teammates behind! See if anyone else needs a hand before you start a new challenge.

## Overview

Now that we have some code, we need an environment to deploy it to! The term Infrastructure as Code (IaC) refers to using templates (code) to repeatedly and consistently create the dev, test, prod (infrastructure) environments. We can automate the process of deploying the Azure services we need with an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

## Objectives

We will use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of our Azure infrastructure. For our application, we will deploy 3 environments: `dev`, `test` and `prod`. Each environment will have its own Web App, however all of our environments will share a single Resource Group, App Service Plan, Application Insights instance, and Azure Container Registry. 

üìù NOTE: In real deployments, all your environments will likely not share these resources.

1. Review the ARM template. Notice how it defines a number of parameters and uses them to create the Resource Group, App Service Plan, Web App, Application Insights, and Azure Container Registry. 

2. Using Visual Studio Code, update the parameters section of the ARM template, replacing all instances of `<prefix>` with a unique lowercase 5 letter name. The resulting name needs to be globally unique to correctly provision resources.

    <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
    Remember to commit and push your changes! 
    <ul>
    <li>In the command line enter: <code>git add --all</code> - This will add all of the files you just copied to the folder to be be tracked.</li>
    <li>Now we need to commit our changes by typing <code>git commit -am "My prefix"</code></li>
    <li>Finally we need to push to the remote repository in github by doing <code>git push -u</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    </details>

üìù NOTE: The `webAppName` parameter on line #6 - you will override this placeholder value later when you call the ARM template.

3. Create a GitHub workflow (`deploy.yml`) that runs manually (*not* triggered by a push or pull request).

    <details>
    <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
    To create a workflow:
    <ol>
    <li>In your repository, select <strong>Actions</strong></li>
    <li>Search for <strong>Manual workflow</strong> and select <strong>Configure</strong></li>
    <li>Provide a name for your workflow, with the <code>name:</code> property</li>
    <li>To make your workflow run manually, use the following code:<br />
      <code>on:</code><br />
      <code> workflow_dispatch:</code><br />
    </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    <li>Refer to the <strong>documentation</strong> tab of your workflow for more details</li>
    <li>Any lines starting with a <code>#</code> are comments, you can read them to learn more, or delete them if you like</li>
    <li>Continue with step 4 to configure the remainder of your workflow</li>
    </ul>
    </details>

4. Configure your workflow to accomplish the following:

    - Checkout your code using a <strong>checkout</strong> action

        <details>
        <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
        A GitHub Action workflow can have multiple jobs and jobs can have multiple steps, your current workflow likely has a job called <code>greet:</code>. You can rename this if you like, <code>build-and-deploy</code> is frequently used as a name in examples.
        <ol>
        <li>Search the marketplace for an <strong>Checkout</strong> Action</li>
        <li>Select the action and select the latest version to see the code snippet</li>
        <li>You can review the snippet, but for your purposes you can keep it simple, and just include two lines immediately after <code>    steps:</code> in your YAML file:
        <code>- name: Checkout</code><br/>
        <code>  uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0</code></br/>
        <ol>
        </details>

    - Use a service principal to authenticate to Azure

        <details>
        <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
        <ol>
        <li>Search the marketplace for an <strong>Azure login</strong> Action</li>
        <li>Select the action and select the latest version to see the code snippet</li>
        <li>Copy the code and add the content under <code>steps:</code></li>
        <br/>
          üóà NOTE: Indentation is important in YAML, intellisense will likely red underline text that is not indented correctly. If required, use tab to indent all the text you've added.
        <br/>

        <li>See the documentation for the Azure Login action by selecting the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login#github-actions-for-deploying-to-azure"><strong>View full Marketplace listing</strong></a> link</li>
        <li>You will see that you're going to need some secrets, learn about GitHub Secrets <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository">here</a></li>
        <li>You will need to create a secret, details for that are in the Marketplace listing <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login#configure-deployment-credentials">here</a></li>
        <li>Your coach can provide the details required for the credentials</li>
        </ol>
        </details>

    - Use the "Deploy Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template" action to call your ARM template in your repo

        <details>
        <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
        <ul>
        <li>Use what you learned in the previous step to complete this step, you will want to review the Marketplace listing to determine which properties you need to provide</li>
        <li>You might choose to store sensitive information like the Subscription ID as a secret</li>
        </ul>
        </details>

        ‚ùó IMPORTANT: Make sure you have completed the Azure setup step before continuing, more details [here](../../Setup/readme.md).

5. Manually run your workflow. When your workflow completes successfully, go to the Azure portal to see the `dev` environment. 

      <details>
      <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
      <ul>
      <li>To manually run your workflow, navigate to <strong>Actions</strong>, select your workflow and select <strong>Run workflow</strong></li>
      </ul>
      </details>

      ‚ùó If you get an error, spend a few moments troubleshooting, but don't get blocked for too long, ask your team for help, or your coach if required. There is a lot to learn in this hackathon, and you will miss out on some cool stuff if you spend too much time stuck here.

      ‚úîÔ∏è If everything worked, we are going to call the ARM template again, but override the `webAppName` parameter in the ARM template.

6. Create an environment variable called `targetEnv` in your workflow and set the *value* to *test*

      <details>
      <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
      <ul>
      <li>Read more about Environment Variables <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#about-environment-variables">here</a></li>
      <code>env:</code><br/>
      <code>    targetEnv: test</code><br/>
      </ul>
      </details>

7. Update your "Deploy Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template" action to call your ARM template in your repo and override the `webAppName` parameter with the new `targetEnv` environment variable.

      <details>
      <summary>üí° Tips and Tricks</summary>
      <ul>
      <li>Use the parameters of the ARM template to pass in the environment variable, <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-azure-resource-manager-arm-template#example-1">this example</a> shows how to use a simple string, but you will need to inject your environment with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#about-environment-variables">interpolation</a>.</li>
      <li>Use the name from line six (6) in your ARM Template</li>
      <code>        template: ./ARM-Templates/container-webapp-template.json</code><br/>
      <code>parameters: webAppName=&lt;webAppName from ARM template&gt;-${{ env.targetEnv }}</code><br/>
      </ul>
      </details>

8. Rerun the workflow. When your workflow completes successfully, go to the Azure portal to see the new `test` App Service. 

9. If everything worked, replace the "test" in your `targetEnv` with "prod" and rerun the workflow. When your workflow completes successfully, go to the Azure portal to see the new `prod` App Service. 

You should see all three environments in Azure.

## Success Criteria

- Your `deploy.yaml` workflow completes without any errors and overrides the `webAppName` parameter when calling the ARM template.
- Your resource group contains 6 resources: 3 App Services (dev, test, prod), 1 Application Insights, 1 App Service plan and 1 Container registry. 

Your YAML file should look similar to:

```yaml
name: Manual workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  
env:
  targetEnv: prod

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    - uses: Azure/arm-deploy@v1
      with:
        scope: resourcegroup
        subscriptionId: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
        resourceGroupName: <Your resource group name>
        template: ./ARM-Templates/container-webapp-template.json
        parameters: webAppName=<Your unique webapp prefix>-${{ env.targetEnv }}
```
