# 2 - DevOps with GitHub

## Introduction

DevOps should be considered a journey, not a destination. The goal of this challenge is to introduce you to GitHub and some really common DevOps practices. While you will be using a DotNet app and Azure during this challenge, the practices explored in this hackathon are transferrable across platforms and languages.

## Before you begin

* Check out the detailed setup guide [here](../../Setup/readme.md)
* Every challenge is dependent on the previous challenges, make sure you work through them in order
* Don't leave your team mates behind! See if anyone else needs a hand before you start a new challenge
