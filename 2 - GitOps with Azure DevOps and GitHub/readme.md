# 1 - GitOps with Azure DevOps and GitHub

## Introduction

GitOps is all about applying code-based processes to traditional infrastructure management. It incorporates Infrastructure as Code (IaC), collaboration, and CI/CD  (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery). Git becomes the source of truth for your infrastructure. GitOps is an evolution of Operations or Infrastructure processes.

Git is used to create, update and delete infrastructure and Git Pull Requests are used to verify and deploy infrastructure, often automatically.

Letâ€™s get started with GitOps!


## Before you begin

Check out the detailed setup guide [here](Setup/readme.md).

## Challenges

The challenges in this hack are broken into two tracks. There is an Azure DevOps track and a GitHub track. Both achieve the same goal, but in their own unique way. Choose one track to work with, your team will all be working ont he same track.
