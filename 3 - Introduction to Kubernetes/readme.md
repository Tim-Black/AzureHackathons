# 3 - Introduction to Kubernetes

## Introduction

Kubernetes is the defacto standard for managing containerized workloads and services. It supports declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes is widely adopted, and has a rapidly growing ecosystem.

## About You

You'll get the most out of this hackathon if you are relatively new to Docker and Kubernetes and want to learn more about containers and container orchestration. You should have some experience with either Windows or Linux using command-line tools.

## Learning Objectives

In a series of 9 cloud-platform agnostic challenges you'll learn how to create and deploy containerized applications using Docker, then you'll move onto Kubernetes where you will deploy pods, create deployments, configure services and scale your app.

## Before you begin

- Speak to a coach to get setup, you'll be provided with a pre-configured Virtual Machine for this hackathon, all you'll need is a Remote Desktop client.
- Every challenge is dependent on the previous challenges, make sure you work through them in order.
- Don't leave your team mates behind! See if anyone else needs a hand before you start a new challenge.
